Welcome to the Recipe App Project Repository!


# Introduction


This project was develop within Trybe Bootcamp, being the last project on Front-End Module. In this group project, we had the opportunity to practice our React skills from React Hooks to Context API and using multiple librarys such as Redux and React-Router. 

## What was developed?

In this project, our group had to develop a recipes app using React Hooks and Context API. For that, two differents API's were used: The Meal DB and The Cocktail DB. In each of this API's there were multiple endpoints that had to be used, so the app could search for meals and drinks using differents types of filters and querys. For that reason, a custom Hook were created, to optimize the system development and to provide a cleaner and modular code.

It was also developed a logic to start, continue and end recipes, which were saved in a completed recipes list.

The layout should be of a mobile App.
